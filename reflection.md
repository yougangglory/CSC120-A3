- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It is not easy nor too difficult. It is just a little bit in the average. I find it good to learn more about the language.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I haven't taken python programming classes before but from the little I learned these two last weeks, I think that programming in general is just a matter of logic. Signs and syntax differs from one language to another but the logic helps figure out what we want.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I was able to respect the number of rounds, Split and Print static sentences at the end of the conversation. I was capable to figure out the dilenma of the mirror words for the words ( you, am,are,I'm and your) but for the words I and my, the mirror words changes twice and give back the same problem. An advice I will give is to start small, seek for help, try on your own, understand the logic rather than just cramming the codes.
